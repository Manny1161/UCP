My game of life program is partially complete. If you run the blinker, beacon and toad files
the program will run with no issues, but when you try run the bigger files like pulsar.txt,
for some reason program just outputs a white space, with the right dimensions, just not with
the right contents. I was'nt able to figure out why this was the case, hence me righting this
short report :)
